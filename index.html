      <p> So, technically, Mr. West sometimes refers to himself a "Ye," but he has yet to copyright the term and I've since decided to embody it. </p>
      <p> My name is <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/erick-manrique-043144189/" target="_blank"> Erick Manrique</a>, I am a student at <a href="https://www.thinkful.com/" target="_blank"> Thinkful's </a> Software Engineer Immersion Program. </p>
      <p> Originally born in Argentina, I was raised on both sides of the Hudson River between NYC and New Jersey. Currently based in South Florida, I am never to far from the beach, the city, or the wildlife (Florida Man included). </p>

        </header>
          <p> One day, not too long ago, I came across a certain <a href="https://www.thinkful.com" target="_blank">website</a> that promised a high-paying career, in a high-demand industry, and naturally, it peaked my interest. After researching their claims on my own, I found they weren't kidding. Software development will play an foundational role in a society that's rapidly diving into technology and the future.</p>
          <p> I had to see if I had what it takes, so I started dabbling on <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.com" target="_blank">freeCodeCamp</a> and found myself pretty fascinated. I had to dive deeper, so deep, I ended up here, building my very first webpage! </p>
            <p> There's a long road ahead of me still, I wouldn't be here if not for my goals and my interests. Below, I've helped visualize what those might be! Check them out! </p>

          <!-- too long
        <p> If you asked me a year ago, I thought my future had nothing but restaurants in it. Inspired by my dad, I wanted to end up in a fancy restaurant, in an expensive city, but I had to start somewhere. That's where I found <a href="https://www.chipotle.com/values"> Chipotle</a> and immediately fell in love. I was fascinated by the culinary art behind turning a raw product into a delicious meal you had to come back for, as well as, crafting an environment that felt inviting to the guests. </p>
        <p> I walked that walk for a while, the goal of ownership driving my every step. As I grew into fancier places, gradually climbing their ladder, I realized I wanted to be sat at the tables I was caring for. -->
