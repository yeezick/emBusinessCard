<!-- So you wanted to look at my code? i'm flattered but it isn't much, YET! As I expand on my knowledge, I'll expand on this code and one day it's going to be a virtual rollercoaster.. maybe something like that movie Bandersnatch on Netflix. Stick around and grow with me! -->

      <p> Welcome to my virtual business card! </p>
      <p> It's not much, but I expect it to be ALOT more within the next year. I'd like to see if I can get involved in designing game engines so this website is destined to be <b> epic</b> one day. Anyway, get to know me!</p>
      <!-- **build on this
      <p>
       I'm treating it as practice project to showcase my growing skills as a web developer. As you get to know me, you might see the word, "Yeezick", being thrown around. Yeezick is actually more of a name than a word, click it to find out more! 
      </p>
      <p> Enjoy the animation, click it if you dare. 
      </p>
      ** insert CSS animation like a bouncing ball, add a cool noise effect when the user clicks it-->

      <p> My name is <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/erick-manrique-043144189/" target="_blank"> Erick Manrique</a> & I am a self-teaching beginner software developer. </p>
      <p> Originally born in Argentina, I was raised on both sides of the Hudson River between NYC and New Jersey. Currently based in South Florida, I am never too far from the beach, the city, or the wildlife (Florida Man included). </p>
      <p> At the moment, I spend a lot of my free-time self-teaching myself how to code! The internet is... built for anyone willing to put in the work and learn software development. There's a long road ahead of me still, I wouldn't be here if not for my goals and interests. Below, I've helped visualize what those might be, check them out! </p>

                  <p> It's been a short & simple ride, but I hope it goes to show the interest and practice that goes into learning to be a developer. Regardless, it's been a blast letting you know who I am, but I'd love to hear from you too! </p>
                  <p> Please reach out to me if you want to get connected or have any questions! Any one of the methods below will work, but if you're here regarding work, here is my <a href='images/emRes.pdf'> resume</a>. </p>
